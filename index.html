                    We don't advertise our roles.
                    Instead we focus on recruitment by referral and knowing the people who are highly sought after in the marketplace.

                    I've worked with lots of great people who are passionate about what they do.
                    I genuinely enjoy helping people find jobs they will love.

                <p>
                    My approach to recruitment is partnership based.
                    We will treat your business as if it was our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a business, I can find you the best talent.
                    If you work in technology, I can help find your perfect job.

                <p>
                    I’ll be honest about how the search is going, what people say about your company and our next steps.
                    By working in a partnership I’ll be on the lookout for someone who could make a real difference to your business.
                    I focus my efforts on meeting people, networking and selling your business.
                </p>

                <h2>Candidates</h2>
                <p>
                    You might not feel ready to look and you might not hate your job just yet.
                    Or maybe you do hate your job.
                    We can work actively or passively together - put a plan in place of who you’d like to work for and I’ll do the hunting, or we can simply wait for a suitable role to come up, if you’re not in a hurry.

                <p>
                    If you are looking to hire geeks or friends of geeks then we should talk.
                    The thing that connects my network within the IT industry is that they have a passion for what they do and like to work with the latest technologies and methodologies.
                    Oh, and they're a pretty smart bunch too.
